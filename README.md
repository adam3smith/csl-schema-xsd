# CSL Schema XSD

The [Schema for the Citation Style Language](https://github.com/citation-style-language/schema) converted from RNC to XSD using [trang](https://relaxng.org/jclark/trang.html). XSD appears to be more widely supported for validation in editors so, to the extent that the automated conversion worked, this might come in handy.
